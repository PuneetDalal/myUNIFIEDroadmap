# myUNIFIEDroadmap
This repository is the public record of my journey toward mastering an interdisciplinary skill set across AI, Robotics, Cloud Computing, and Data Science.
It is structured into weekly logs, where each week I will:
Commit code from completed assignments and projects.
Add insightful notes and summaries of the concepts I've learned.
Document my progress as I build a comprehensive and practical understanding of these domains.
All development for this repository is being done exclusively through the Linux command line to simultaneously build deep proficiency in a professional systems environment.
