Q1) What is the difference between a "vector" and a simple "point"?
	ans: A vector can be anything where there is a sensible notion of adding two vectors and multiplying a vector by a number. geometrically they can be thought of lines/arrows in a space can be 2-d or 3-d or even n-d where these lines/arrpws seems to have a sense of direction(defined by the arrowhead) along with their length representing their magnitude whereas a simple point is just a location or positions on coordinate axis .They don't have any sense of direction or magnitude. just a set of number lying in 2-d 3-d or n-d planes or coordinate systems
Q2) What is "span"?
	ans:Set of all linear combinations of a set of vectors is called their span(and it can reach every point in 2-d ,3-d or n-d space given that they are not zero vectors and don't point in the same direction)
